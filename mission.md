The Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Data, Planning and Analysis group has over 15 standing committees. The group's young member subcommittee was established to support young member involvement in these committees, highlight young member contributions to the sector, and better connect young members with transportation professionals in the data, planning and analysis sectors.

## Specific Goals

 1. Involvement: provide opportunities for young professionals to get involved.
 2. Resources: provide resources for young professionals in the transportation data, planning and analysis sector. This might include events, online resources or mentorship opportunities.
 3. Connections: provide networking opportunities for young professionals.
 4. Representation: support young member participation on standing committees.
