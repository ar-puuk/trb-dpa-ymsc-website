The Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Data, Planning and Analysis group has over 15 standing committees. The group's young member subcommittee was established to support young member involvement in these committees, highlight young member contributions to the sector, and better connect young members with transportation professionals in the data, planning and analysis sectors.
